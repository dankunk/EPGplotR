Description: EPGplotR allows users to load insect electrical penetration graph (EPG) files (with a .D0# extension) into R, plot the signals, and annotate them by behavior. EPGplotR also allows users to interactively explore EPG recordings, segment and inspect waveforms of interest, and save high-quality figures to disc. EPGplotR is built with ggplot2 and plotly, and most of the plots can be further edited using commands from those respective packages.
