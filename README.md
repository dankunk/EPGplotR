EPGplotR allows users to load insect electrical penetration graph (EPG) 
 files (with a .D0# extension) into R, plot the signals, and annotate them by behavior. 
 EPGplotR also allows users to interactively explore EPG recordings, segment and inspect 
 waveforms of interest, and save high-quality figures to disc. EPGplotR is built with 
 ggplot2 and plotly, and most of the plots can be further edited using 
 commands from their respective packages. add svg
