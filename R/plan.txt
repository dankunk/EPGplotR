# Update V1
We have a workflow that first:
-loads in recordings with load_d0x_files()
-loads in ana files with load_ana_file()
-assigns behavior codes to the recording file dataframe with assign_behavior_codes()
-plot interactively with the plot_signal() function.

# Next steps # mostly complete
- make a ggplot version that will make a static plot with the same color representations.
    this is updated wit the gg_plot_signal funtion.

- make the ggplot version have an argument that will save to disc.
- enhance the saving argument to allow for wide plots
  in gg_plot_signal() there are now arguments for output_file and figure_type both default to null and wide respectively.

# next step is making a logo.


# then configuring git to github and pushing to a repo.




# if possible ## update not really possible at the moment
- make a function for animated ggplots.
- be able to save these to disc as well.

# generate easy functions to annotate events PD, E1, etc. with a label. This could be useful for seeing short events.
